Things to check in Proofs:

* Check color for consistency

* Check centering off page content (Eyeball Logo on cover, footer lines, Joypad
  rendering, installer images, etc.)

* Verify transparent corners of mac window captures render transparent/white

Workflows:

-All the graphics in the manual are available in the assets directory of
 this repo.

-Run make_pdf.sh to export the skunk_manual.odt file to skunk_manual.pdf

-Run make_book.sh to export the skunk_manual.odt file to skunk_manual.pdf and
 generate a print-ready booklet PDF, with two manual pages per PDF page, and
 1/4" of bleed.

 ***When printing these, Set printer to duplex using long-edge***

-If the booklet pages must be sized up to 11x8.5, "print" them to PDF from
 Preview on mac, being sure scaling is set to 100% and output is set to
 landscape. There are probably better ways, but I haven't needed to use this
 workflow in practice, so I haven't investigated further.

Fonts:

The following fonts are used, and must be installed when converting from
OpenDocument format to PDF, even though they are embedded in skunk_manual.odt:

* Arial Black: From Microsoft. Sorry. Details on how to get this font, as well
  as its licensing information, are available here:

    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/arial-black

  This is probably the only non-free asset used in the entire project, but from
  my understanding (IANAL), it's only $35 at the time of writing to buy a stand-
  alone license for this font suitable for producing print documents from it,
  it's included with Windows if you have a license for that, and if you're
  producing SkunkBoards or hard-copy documentation, you probably already have
  this and/or the cost is nothing compared to what your other costs are going
  to be. I considered replacing it, but nothing else looks quite as good. If
  you're just producing some quick PDFs for personal use, this font is only used
  on the cover page, so substituting something like DejaVu Sans Bold (Included
  in LibreOffice, looks OK) won't throw off the formatting or anything. It just
  won't have the same impact IMHO ;-)

* Liberation Sans family: Included in LibreOffice
* Liberation Serif family: Included in LibreOffice
* Liberation Mono: Included in LibreOffice
* OpenSymbol: Included in LibreOffice
* Frutiger and a vintage version of Helvetica, as used in the original Atari
  Manuals, are used in the Joypad graphic, but I've converted the text to paths
  in this SVG prior to importing it to the manual document, as those ancient
  fonts are difficult to install & use on modern systems. For the brave, they
  can be found here:

Printing:

* Print on glossy coated 80lb text weight paper for internal pages, glossy
  coated 80lb cover weight paper for cover pages.

* Used glossy UV lamination on outside of cover.

* Finished size is 4.5" x 6.5". Document contains 0.25" bleed on all edges.
